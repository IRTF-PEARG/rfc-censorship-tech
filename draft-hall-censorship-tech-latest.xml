<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>This document describes the technical mechanisms used by censorship
regimes around the world to block or degrade internet traffic (see
<xref target="RFC7754"/> for a discussion of Internet blocking and filtering
in terms of Internet architecture). To that
end, we describe three elements of Internet censorship: aggregation,
identification, and prevention. Aggregation is the process by which
censors determine what they should block, i.e. they decide to block a
list of pornographic websites. Identification is the process by which
censors determine whether content is blocked, i.e. the censor blocks
all webpages containing “sex” in the title. Prevention is the process
by which the censor intercedes in communication and prevents access to
censored materials.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tech-aggregation" title="Technical Aggregation">

<t>Aggregation is the process of figuring out what censors would like to
block <xref target="Glanville-2008"/>. Generally, censors aggregate “to block”
information in three possible sorts of blacklists: Keyword, Domain
Name, or IP. Keyword and Domain Name blocking take place at the
application level (e.g. HTTP), whereas IP blocking tends to take place
in the TCP/IP header. The mechanisms for building up these blacklists
are varied. Many times private industries that sell “content control”
software, such as SmartFilter, provide their services to nations which
can then pick from broad categories, such as gambling or pornography,
that they would like to block . In these cases, the private services
embark on an attempt to label every semi-questionable website as to
allow for this metatag blocking. Countries that are more interested in
retaining specific political control, a desire which requires swift
and decisive action, often have ministries or organizations, such as
the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China or the
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance in Iran, which maintain their
own blacklists.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tech-id" title="Technical Identification">

<section anchor="poc" title="Points of Control">

<t>Digital censorship, necessarily, takes place over a network. Network
design gives censors a number of different points-of-control where
they can identify the content they are interested in filtering. An
important aspect of pervasive technical interception is the necessity
to rely on software or hardware to intercept the content the censor is
interested in. This requirement, the need to have the interception
mechanism located somewhere, logically or physically, implicates four
general points-of-control:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Internet Backbone: If a censor controls the gateways into a region,
they can filter undesirable traffic that is traveling into and out
of the region by sniffing and mirroring at the relevant exchange
points. Censorship at this point-of-control is most effective at
controlling the flow of information between a region and the rest of
the internet, but is ineffective at identifying content traveling
between the users within a region.</t>
  <t>Internet Service Providers: Internet Service Providers are perhaps
the most natural point-of-control. They have a benefit of being
easily enumerable by a censor paired with the ability to identify
the regional and international traffic of all their users. The
censor’s filtration mechanisms can be placed on an ISP via
governmental mandates, ownership, or voluntary/coercive influence.</t>
  <t>Institutions: Private institutions such as corporations, schools,
and cyber cafes can put filtration mechanisms in place. These
mechanisms are occasionally at the request of a censor, but are more
often implemented to help achieve institutional goals, such as to
prevent the viewing of pornography on school computers.</t>
  <t>Personal Devices: Censors can mandate censorship software be
installed on the device level. This has many disadvantages in terms
of scalability, ease-of-circumvention, and operating system
requirements. The emergence of mobile devices exacerbate these
feasibility problems.</t>
</list></t>

<t>At all levels of the network hierarchy, the filtration mechanisms used
to detect undesirable traffic are essentially the same: a censor
sniffs transmitting packets and identifies undesirable content, and
then uses a blocking or shaping mechanism to prevent or degrade
access.  Identification of undesirable traffic can occur at the
application, transport, or network layer of the IP stack. Censors are
almost always concerned with web traffic, so the relevant protocols
tend to be filtered in predictable ways. For example, a subversive
image would always make it past a keyword filter, but the IP address
of the site serving the image may be blacklisted when identified as a
provider of undesirable content.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-layer" title="Application Layer">

<section anchor="http-request-header-identification" title="HTTP Request Header Identification">

<t>An HTTP header contains a lot of useful information for traffic
identification; although host is the only required field in an HTTP
request header, an HTTP method field is necessary to do anything
useful. As such, the method and host fields are the two fields used
most often for ubiquitous censorship. A censor can sniff traffic and
identify a specific domain name (host) and usually a page name (GET
/page) as well. This identification technique is usually paired with
TCP/IP header identification (see <xref target="sec_tcpid"></xref>) for a more robust
method.</t>

<t>Tradeoffs: Request Identification is a technically straight-forward
identification method that can be easily implemented at the Backbone
or ISP level. The hardware needed for this sort of identification is
cheap and easy-to-acquire, making it desirable when budget and scope
are a concern. HTTPS will encrypt the relevant request and response
fields, so pairing with TCP/IP identification (see <xref target="sec_tcpid"></xref>) is
necessary for filtering of HTTPS.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: Studies exploring censorship mechanisms have found
evidence of HTTP header/ URL filtering in many countries, including
Bangladesh, Bahrain, China, India, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey
<xref target="Verkamp-2012"/><xref target="Nabi-2013"/><xref target="Aryan-2012"/>. Commercial technologies
such as the McAfee SmartFilter and NetSweeper are often purchased by
censors <xref target="Dalek-2013"/>.  These commercial technologies use a
combination of HTTP Request Identification and TCP/IP Header
Identification to filter specific URLs. Dalek et al. and Jones et
al. identified the use of these products in the wild
<xref target="Dalek-2013"/><xref target="Jones-2014"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="http-response-header-identification" title="HTTP Response Header Identification">

<t>While HTTP Request Header Identification relies on the information
contained in the HTTP request from client to server, response
identification uses information sent in response by the server to
client to identify undesirable content.</t>

<t>Tradeoffs: As with HTTP Request Header Identification, the techniques
used to identify HTTP traffic are well-known, cheap, and relatively
easy to implement, but is made useless by HTTPS, because the response
in HTTPS is encrypted, including headers.</t>

<t>The response fields are also less helpful for identifying content than
request fields, as Server could easily be identified using HTTP
Request Header identification, and Via is rarely relevant.  HTTP
Response censorship mechanisms normally let the first n packets
through while the mirrored traffic is being processed; this may allow
some content through and the user may be able to detect that the
censor is actively interfering with undesirable content.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: In 2009, Jong Park et al. at the University of New
Mexico demonstrated that the Great Firewall of China (GFW) used this
technique <xref target="Crandall-2010"/>. However, Jong Park et al. found that the
GFW discontinued this practice during the course of the study. Due to
the overlap in HTTP response filtering and keyword filtering (see
<xref target="kw-filt"></xref>), it is likely that most censors rely on keyword
filtering over TCP streams instead of HTTP response filtering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="kw-filt" title="Instrumenting Content Providers">

<t>In addition to censorship by the state, many governments pressure
content providers to censor themselves. Due to the extensive reach of
government censorship, we need to define content provider as any
service that provides utility to users, including everything from web
sites to locally installed programs. The defining factor of keyword
identification by content providers is the choice of content providers
to detect restricted terms on their platform. The terms to look for
may be provided by the government or the content provider may be
expected to come up with their own list.</t>

<t>Tradeoffs: By instrumenting content providers to identify restricted
content, the censor can gain new information at the cost of political
capital with the companies it forces or encourages to participate in
censorship. For example, the censor can gain insight about the content
of encrypted traffic by coercing web sites to identify restricted
content, but this may drive away potential investment. Coercing
content providers may encourage self censorship, an additional
advantage for censors. The tradeoffs for instrumenting content
providers are highly dependent on the content provider and the
requested assistance.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: Researchers have discovered keyword identification
by content providers on platforms ranging from instant messaging
applications <xref target="Senft-2013"/> to search engines
<xref target="Rushe-2015"/><xref target="Cheng-2010"/><xref target="Whittaker-2013"/><xref target="BBC-2013"/><xref target="Condliffe-2013"/>. To
demonstrate the prevalence of this type of keyword identification, we
look to search engine censorship.</t>

<t>Search engine censorship demonstrates keyword identification by
content providers and can be regional or worldwide.  Implementation is
occasionally voluntary, but normally is based on laws and regulations
of the country a search engine is operating in. The keyword blacklists
are most likely maintained by the search engine provider. China
requires search engine providers to “voluntarily” maintain search term
blacklists to acquire/keep an Internet content provider (ICP) license
<xref target="Cheng-2010"/>.  It is clear these blacklists are maintained by each
search engine provider based on the slight variations in the
intercepted searches <xref target="Zhu-2011"/><xref target="Whittaker-2013"/>. The United
Kingdom has been pushing search engines to self censor with the threat
of litigation if they don’t do it themselves: Google and Microsoft
have agreed to block more than 100,00 queries in U.K. to help combat
abuse <xref target="BBC-2013"/><xref target="Condliffe-2013"/>.</t>

<t>Depending on the output, search engine keyword identification may be
difficult or easy to detect. In some cases specialized or blank
results provide a trivial enumeration mechanism, but more subtle
censorship can be difficult to detect. In February, Microsoft’s search
engine, Bing, was accused of censoring Chinese content outside of
China <xref target="Rushe-2015"/> because Bing returned different results for
censored terms in Chinese and English. However, it is possible that
censorship of the largest base of Chinese search users, China, biased
Bing’s results so that the more popular results in China (the
uncensored results) were also more popular for Chinese speakers
outside of China.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dpi" title="Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Identification">

<t>Deep Packet Inspection has become computationally feasible as a
censorship mechanism in the past 5 years <xref target="Wagner-2009"/>. Unlike other
techniques, DPI reassembles network flows to examine the application
“data” section, as opposed to only the header, and is therefore often
used for keyword identification. DPI also differs from other
identification technologies because it can leverage additional packet
and flow characteristics, i.e. packet sizes and timings, to identify
content. To prevent substantial quality of service (QoS) impacts, DPI
normally analyzes a copy of data while the original packets continue
to be routed. Typically, the traffic is split using either a mirror
switch or fiber splitter, and analyzed on a cluster of machines
running Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) configured for censorship.</t>

<t>Tradeoffs: DPI is one of the most expensive identification mechanisms
and can have a large QoS impact <xref target="Porter-2010"/>.  When used as a
keyword filter for TCP flows, DPI systems can cause also major
overblocking problems. Like other techniques, DPI is less useful
against encrypted data, though DPI can leverage unencrypted elements
of an encrypted data flow (e.g., the Server Name Indicator (SNI) sent
in the clear for TLS) or statistical information about an encrypted
flow (e.g., video takes more bandwidth than audio or textual forms of
communication) to identify traffic.</t>

<t>Despite these problems, DPI is the most powerful identification method
and is widely used in practice. The Great Firewall of China (GFW), the
largest censorship system in the world, uses DPI to identify
restricted content over HTTP and DNS and inject TCP RSTs and bad DNS
responses, respectively, into connections
<xref target="Crandall-2010"/><xref target="Clayton-2006"/><xref target="Anonymous-2014"/>.</t>

<t>Empirical Evidence: Several studies have found evidence of DPI being
used to censor content and tools. Clayton et al. Crandal et al.,
Anonymous, and Khattak et al., all explored the GFW and Khattak et
al. even probed the firewall to discover implementation details like
how much state it stores
<xref target="Crandall-2010"/><xref target="Clayton-2006"/><xref target="Anonymous-2014"/><xref target="Khattak-2013"/>. The
Tor project claims that China, Iran, Ethiopia, and others must being
using DPI to block the obsf2 protocol <xref target="Wilde-2012"/>.  Malaysia has
been accused of using targeted DPI, paired with DDoS, to identify and
subsequently knockout pro-opposition material <xref target="Wagstaff-2013"/>.  It
also seems likely that organizations not so worried about blocking
content in real-time could use DPI to sort and categorically search
gathered traffic using technologies such as NarusInsight
<xref target="Hepting-2011"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="transport" title="Transport Layer">

<section anchor="sec_tcpid" title="TCP/IP Header Identification">

<t>TCP/IP Header Identification is the most pervasive, reliable, and
predictable type of identification.  TCP/IP headers contain a few
invaluable pieces of information that must be transparent for traffic
to be successfully routed: destination and source IP address and port.
Destination and Source IP are doubly useful, as not only does it allow
a censor to block undesirable content via IP blacklisting, but also
allows a censor to identify the IP of the user making the
request. Port is useful for whitelisting certain applications.</t>

<t>Trade-offs: TCP/IP identification is popular due to its simplicity,
availability, and robustness.</t>

<t>TCP/IP identification is trivial to implement, but is difficult to
implement in backbone or ISP routers at scale, and is therefore
typically implemented with DPI. Blacklisting an IP is equivalent to
installing a /32 route on a router and due to limited flow table
space, this cannot scale beyond a few thousand IPs at most. IP
blocking is also relatively crude, leading to overblocking, and cannot
deal with some services like Content Distribution Networks (CDN), that
host content at hundreds or thousands of IP addresses. Despite these
limitations, IP blocking is extremely effective because the user needs
to proxy their traffic through another destination to circumvent this
type of identification.</t>

<t>Port-blocking is generally not useful because many types of content
share the same port and it is possible for censored applications to
change their port. For example, most HTTP traffic goes over port 80,
so the censor cannot differentiate between restricted and allowed
content solely on the basis of port. Port whitelisting is occasionally
used, where a censor limits communication to approved ports, such as
80 for HTTP traffic and is most effective when used in conjunction with
other identification mechanisms. For example, a censor could block the
default HTTPS port, port 443, thereby forcing most users to fall back
to HTTP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="prot-id" title="Protocol Identification">

<t>Censors sometimes identify entire protocols to be blocked using a
variety of traffic characteristics.  For example, Iran degrades the
performance of HTTPS traffic, a protocol that prevents further
analysis, to encourage users to switch to HTTP, a protocol that they
can analyze <xref target="Aryan-2012"/>. A simple protocol identification
would be to recognize all TCP traffic over port 443 as HTTPS, but more
sophisticated analysis of the statistical properties of payload data
and flow behavior, would be more effective, even when port 443 is not
used <xref target="Hjelmvik-2010"/><xref target="Sandvine-2014"/>.</t>

<t>If censors can detect circumvention tools, they can block them, so
censors like China are extremely interested in identifying the
protocols for censorship circumvention tools. In recent years, this
has devolved into an arms race between censors and circumvention tool
developers. As part of this arms race, China developed an extremely
effective protocol identification technique that researchers call
active probing or active scanning.</t>

<t>In active probing, the censor determines whether hosts are running a
circumvention protocol by trying to initiate communication using the
circumvention protocol. If the host and the censor successfully
negotiate a connection, then the censor conclusively knows that host
is running a circumvention tool. China has used active scanning to
great effect to block Tor <xref target="Winter-2012"/>.</t>

<t>Trade-offs: Protocol Identification necessarily only provides insight
into the way information is traveling, and not the information itself.</t>

<t>Protocol identification is useful for detecting and blocking
circumvention tools, like Tor, or traffic that is difficult to
analyze, like VoIP or SSL, because the censor can assume that this
traffic should be blocked. However, this can lead to overblocking
problems when used with popular protocols.  These methods are
expensive, both computationally and financially, due to the use of
statistical analysis, and can be ineffective due to its imprecise
nature.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: Protocol identification can be easy to detect if
it is conducted in real time and only a particular protocol is
blocked, but some types of protocol identification, like active
scanning, are much more difficult to detect. Protocol identification
has been used by Iran to identify and throttle SSH traffic to make it
unusable <xref target="Anonymous-2007"/> and by China to identify and block Tor
relays <xref target="Winter-2012"/>. Protocol Identification has also been used for
traffic management, such as the 2007 case where Comcast in the United
States used RST injection to interrupt BitTorrent Traffic
<xref target="Winter-2012"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tech-prev" title="Technical Prevention">

<section anchor="packet-dropping" title="Packet Dropping">

<t>Packet dropping is a simple mechanism to prevent undesirable
traffic. The censor identifies undesirable traffic and chooses to not
properly forward any packets it sees associated with the traversing
undesirable traffic instead of following a normal routing
protocol. This can be paired with any of the previously described
mechanisms so long as the censor knows the user must route traffic
through a controlled router.</t>

<t>Trade offs: Packet Dropping is most successful when every traversing
packet has transparent information linked to undesirable content, such
as a Destination IP. One downside Packet Dropping suffers from is the
necessity of overblocking all content from otherwise allowable IPs
based on a single subversive sub-domain; blogging services and github
repositories are good examples. China famously dropped all github
packets for three days based on a single repository hosting
undesirable content <xref target="Anonymous-2013"/>.  The need to inspect every
traversing packet in close to real time also makes Packet Dropping
somewhat challenging from a QoS perspective.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: Packet Dropping is a very common form of technical
prevention and lends itself to accurate detection given the unique
nature of the time-out requests it leaves in its wake. The Great
Firewall of China uses packet dropping as one of its primary
mechanisms of technical censorship <xref target="Ensafi-2013"/>. Iran also uses
Packet Dropping as the mechanisms for throttling SSH
<xref target="Aryan-2012"/>. These are but two examples of a ubiquitous censorship
practice.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rst-inject" title="RST Packet Injection">

<t>Packet injection, generally, refers to a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
network interference technique that spoofs packets in an established
traffic stream. RST packets are normally used to let one side of TCP
connection know the other side has stopped sending information, and
thus the receiver should close the connection. RST Packet Injection is
a specific type of packet injection attack that is used to interrupt
an established stream by sending RST packets to both sides of a TCP
connection; as each receiver thinks the other has dropped the
connection, the session is terminated.</t>

<t>Trade-offs: RST Packet Injection has a few advantages that make it
extremely popular is a censorship technique. RST Packet Injection is
an out-of-band prevention mechanism, allowing the avoidance of the the
QoS bottleneck one can encounter with inline techniques such as Packet
Dropping. This out-of-band property allows a censor to inspect a copy
of the information, usually mirrored by an optical splitter, making it
an ideal pairing for DPI and Protocol Identification
<xref target="Weaver-2009"/>. RST Packet Injection also has the advantage of only
requiring one of the two endpoints to accept the spoofed packet for
the connection to be interrupted.  The difficult part of RST Packet
Injection is spoofing “enough” correct information to ensure one
end-point accepts a RST packet as legitimate; this generally implies a
correct IP, port, and (TCP) sequence number. Sequence number is the
hardest to get correct, as <xref target="RFC0793"/> specifies an RST Packet should
be in-sequence to be accepted, although the RFC also recommends
allowing in-window packets as “good enough”. This in-window
recommendation is important, as if it is implemented it allows for
successful Blind RST Injection attacks <xref target="Netsec-2011"/>.  When
in-window sequencing is allowed, It is trivial to conduct a Blind RST
Injection, a blind injection implies the censor doesn’t know any
sensitive (encrypted) sequencing information about the TCP stream they
are injecting into, they can simply enumerate the ~70000 possible
windows; this is particularly useful for interrupting
encrypted/obfuscated protocols such as SSH or Tor. RST Packet
Injection relies on a stateful network, making it useless against UDP
connections. RST Packet Injection is among the most popular censorship
techniques used today given its versatile nature and effectiveness
against all types of TCP traffic.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: RST Packet Injection, as mentioned above, is most
often paired with identification techniques that require splitting,
such as DPI or Protocol Identification. In 2007 Comcast was accused of
using RST Packet Injection to interrupt traffic it identified as
BitTorrent <xref target="Schoen-2007"/>, this later led to a US Federal
Communications Commission ruling against Comcast
<xref target="VonLohmann-2008"/>. China has also been known to use RST Packet
Injection for censorship purposes. This prevention is especially
evident in the interruption of encrypted/obfuscated protocols, such as
those used by Tor <xref target="Winter-2012"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dns-mangling" title="DNS Interference">

<t>There are a variety of mechanisms that censors can use to block or
filter access to content by altering responses from the DNS
<xref target="AFNIC-2013"/><xref target="ICANN-SSAC-2012"/>, including blocking the response,
replying with an error message, or responding with an
incorrect address (potentially to a server that can communicate to the
end-user a reason for blocking access to that resource, for example
using HTTP Status Code 451 <xref target="RFC7725"/>).</t>

<t>DNS poisoning refers to a mechanism where a censor interferes
with the response sent by a DNS server to the requesting device by
injecting an alternative IP address into the response message on the
return path <xref target="ViewDNS-2011"/>. Cache poisoning occurs after the
requested site’s name
servers resolve the request and attempt to forward the IP back to the
requesting device; on the return route the resolved IP is recursively
cached by each DNS server that initially forwarded the request. During
this caching process if an undesirable keyword is recognized, the
resolved IP is “poisoned” and an alternative IP (or NXDOMAIN error) is
returned. The
alternative IPs usually direct to a nonsense domain or a warning page.
Alternatively, Iranian censorship appears to prevent
the communication en-route, preventing a response from ever being sent
<xref target="Aryan-2012"/>.</t>

<t>Trade-offs:
DNS interference
requires the censor to force a user to traverse a controlled DNS
hierarchy (or intervening network on which the censor serves as a
Active Pervastive Attacker <xref target="RFC7624"/> to rewrite DNS responses)
for the mechanism to be effective. It can be circumvented
by a technical savvy user that opts to use alternative DNS resolvers
(such as the public DNS resolvers provided by
Google or OpenDNS) or Virtual Private Network technology. DNS poisoning
also implies returning an incorrect IP to
those attempting to resolve a domain name, but in some cases the destination
may be
technically acessible;  over HTTP, for example, the user may have another
method of obtaining the IP
address of the desired site and may be able to access it if the site
is configured to be the
defualt server listening at this IP address.  Blocking overflow has
also been a
problem, as occasionally users outside of the censors region will be
directed through a DNS servers or DNS-rewriting network equipment
controlled by a censor, causing the
request to fail. The ease of circumvention paired with the large risk
of overblocking and blocking overflow make DNS interference a
partial, difficult, and less than ideal censorship mechanism.</t>

<t>Empirical Evidence: DNS interference, when properly implemented, is
easy to identify based on the shortcomings identified above. Turkey
relied on DNS interference for its country-wide block of websites
such Twitter and Youtube for almost week in March of 2014 but the ease
of circumvention resulted in an increase in the popularity of Twitter
until Turkish ISPs implementing an IP blacklist to achieve the
governmental mandate <xref target="Zmijewki-2014"/>. 
Ultimately, Turkish ISPs started hijacking all requests to Google and
Level 3’s international DNS resolvers <xref target="Zmijewki-2014"/>. DNS 
interference, when incorrectly implemented, has resulted in some
of the largest “censorship disasters”.  In January 2014 China started
directing all requests passing through the Great Fire Wall to a single
domain, dongtaiwang.com, due to an improperly configured DNS 
poisoning attempt; this incident is thought to be the largest
internet-service outage in history
<xref target="AFP-2014"/><xref target="Anon-SIGCOMM12"/>. Countries such as China, Iran, Turkey,
and the United States have discussed blocking entire TLDs as well, but
only Iran has acted by blocking all Israeli (.il) domains
<xref target="Albert-2011"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ddos" title="Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)">

<t>Distributed Denial of Service attacks are a common attack mechanism
used by “hacktivists” and black-hat hackers, but censors have used
DDoS in the past for a variety of reasons. There is a huge variety of
DDoS attacks <xref target="Wikip-DoS"/>, but on a high level two possible impacts
tend to occur; a flood attack results in the service being unusable
while resources are being spent to flood the service, a crash attack
aims to crash the service so resources can be reallocated elsewhere
without “releasing” the service.</t>

<t>Trade-offs: DDoS is an appealing mechanism when a censor would like to
prevent all access to undesirable content, instead of only access in
their region for a limited period of time, but this is really the only
uniquely beneficial feature for DDoS as a censorship technique. The
resources required to carry out a successful DDoS against major
targets are computationally expensive, usually requiring renting or
owning a malicious distributed platform such as a botnet, and
imprecise. DDoS is an incredibly crude censorship technique, and
appears to largely be used as a timely, easy-to-access mechanism for
blocking undesirable content for a limited period of time.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: In 2012 the U.K.’s GCHQ used DDoS to temporarily
shutdown IRC chat rooms frequented by members of Anonymous using the
Syn Flood DDoS method; Syn Flood exploits the handshake used by TCP to
overload the victim server with so many requests that legitimate
traffic becomes slow or impossible
<xref target="Schone-2014"/><xref target="CERT-2000"/>. Dissenting opinion websites are
frequently victims of DDoS around politically sensitive events in
Burma <xref target="Villeneuve-2011"/>. Controlling parties in Russia
<xref target="Kravtsova-2012"/>, Zimbabwe <xref target="Orion-2013"/>, and Malaysia
<xref target="Muncaster-2013"/> have been accused of using DDoS to interrupt
opposition support and access during elections.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discon" title="Network Disconnection or Adversarial Route Announcement">

<t>While it is perhaps the crudest of all censorship techniques, there is
no more effective way of making sure undesirable information isn’t
allowed to propagate on the web than by shutting off the network. The
network can be logically cut off in a region when a censoring body
withdraws all of the Boarder Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefixes routing
through the censor’s country.</t>

<t>Trade-offs: The impact to a network disconnection in a region is huge
and absolute; the censor pays for absolute control over digital
information with all the benefits the internet brings; this is never a
long-term solution for any rational censor and is normally only used
as a last resort in times of substantial unrest.</t>

<t>Empirical Examples: Network Disconnections tend to only happen in
times of substantial unrest, largely due to the huge social,
political, and economic impact such a move has. One of the first,
highly covered occurrences was with the Junta in Myanmar employing
Network Disconnection to help Junta forces quash a rebellion in 2007
<xref target="Dobie-2007"/>. China disconnected the network in the Xinjiang region
during unrest in 2009 in an effort to prevent the protests from
spreading to other regions <xref target="Heacock-2009"/>. The Arab Spring saw the
the most frequent usage of Network Disconnection, with events in Egypt

<t>As the name implies, sometimes manpower is the easiest way to figure
out which content to block.  Manual Filtering differs from the common
tactic of building up blacklists in that is doesn’t necessarily target
a specific IP or DNS, but instead removes or flags content.  Given the
imprecise nature of automatic filtering, manually sorting through
content and flagging dissenting websites, blogs, articles and other
media for filtration can be an effective technique.  This filtration
can occur on the Backbone/ISP level – China’s army of monitors is a
good example <xref target="BBC-2013b"/> – but more commonly manual filtering
occurs on an institutional level.  Internet Content Providers such as
Google or Weibo, require a business license to operate in China.  One
of the prerequisites for a business license is an agreement to sign a
“voluntary pledge” known as the “Public Pledge on Self-discipline for
the Chinese Internet Industry”.  The failure to “ energetically
uphold” the pledged values can lead to the ICPs being held liable for
the offending content by the Chinese government <xref target="BBC-2013b"/>.</t>

<section anchor="selfcensor" title="Self Censorship">

<t>Self censorship is one of the most interesting and effective types of
censorship; a mix of Bentham’s Panopticon, cultural manipulation,
intelligence gathering, and meatspace enforcement. Simply put, self
censorship is when a censor creates an atmosphere where users censor
themselves. This can be achieved through controlling information,
intimidating would-be dissidents, swaying public thought, and creating
apathy. Self censorship is difficult to document, as when it is
implemented effectively the only noticeable tracing is a lack of
undesirable content; instead one must look at the tools and techniques
used by censors to encourage self-censorship. Controlling Information
relies on traditional censorship techniques, or by forcing all users
to connect through an intranet, such as in North Korea.  Intimidation
is often achieved through allowing internet users to post “whatever
they want”, but arresting those who post about dissenting views, this
technique is incredibly common
<xref target="Calamur-2013"/><xref target="AP-2012"/><xref target="Hopkins-2011"/><xref target="Guardian-2014"/><xref target="Johnson-2010"/>.
A good example of swaying public thought is China’s “50-Cent Party”,
composed of somewhere between 20,000 <xref target="Bristow-2013"/> and 300,000
<xref target="Fareed-2008"/> contributors who are paid to “guide public thought” on
local and regional issues as directed by the Ministry of
Culture. Creating apathy can be a side-effect of successfully
controlling information over time and is ideal for a censorship regime

<t>As Domain Names are resolved recursively, if a TLD deregisters a

<abstract><t>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on &quot;blocking&quot; and &quot;filtering&quot;, the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches.</t></abstract>
