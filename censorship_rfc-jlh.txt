1.  Introduction

   This document describes the technical mechanisms used by censorship
   regimes around the world to block or degrade internet traffic. To
   that end, we describe three elements of Internet censorship:
   aggregation, identification, and prevention. Aggregation is the
   process by which censors determine what they should block,
   i.e. they decide to block a list of pornographic
   websites. Identification is the process by which censors determine
   whether content is blocked, i.e. the censor blocks all webpages
   containing "sex" in the title. Prevention is the process by which
   the censor intercedes in communication and prevents access to
   censored materials.

2.  Technical Aggregation

   Aggregation is the process of figuring out what censors would like to
   block.  Generally, censors aggregate "to block" information in three
   possible sorts of blacklists: Keyword, Domain Name, or IP.  Keyword
   and Domain Name blocking take place at the application level (e.g.
   HTTP), whereas IP blocking tends to take place in the TCP/IP header.
   The mechanisms for building up these blacklists are varied.  Many
   times private industries that sell "content control" software, such
   as SmartFilter, provide their services to nations which can then pick
   from broad categories, such as gambling or pornography, that they
   would like to block [ref-1].  In these cases, the private services
   embark on an attempt to label every semi-questionable website as to
   allow for this metatag blocking.  Countries that are more interested
   in retaining specific political control, a desire which requires
   swift and decisive action, often have ministries or organizations,
   such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China
   or the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance in Iran, which
   maintain their own blacklists.

3.  Technical Identification

3.1.  Points of Control

   Digital censorship, necessarily, takes place over a network.  Network
   design gives censors a number of different points-of-control where
   they can identify the content they are interested in filtering.  An
   important aspect of pervasive technical interception is the necessity
   to rely on software or hardware to intercept the content the censor
   is interested in.  This requirement, the need to have the
   interception mechanism located somewhere, logically or physically,
   implicates four general points-of-control:

   o  Internet Backbone: If a censor controls the gateways into a
      region, they can filter undesirable traffic that is traveling into
      and out of the region by sniffing and mirroring at the relevant
      exchange points.  Censorship at this point-of-control is most
      effective at controlling the flow of information between a region
      and the rest of the internet, but is ineffective at identifying
      content traveling between the users within a region.

   o  Internet Service Providers: Internet Service Providers are perhaps
      the most natural point-of-control.  They have a benefit of being

      easily enumerable by a censor paired with the ability to identify
      the regional and international traffic of all their users.  The
      censor's filtration mechanisms can be placed on an ISP via
      governmental mandates, ownership, or voluntary/coercive influence.

   o  Institutions: Private institutions such as corporations, schools,
      and cyber cafes can put filtration mechanisms in place.  These
      mechanisms are occasionally at the request of a censor, but are
      more often implemented to help achieve institutional goals, such
      as to prevent the viewing of pornography on school computers.

   o  Personal Devices: Censors can mandate censorship software be
      installed on the device level.  This has many disadvantages in
      terms of scalability, ease-of-circumvention, and operating system
      requirements.  The emergence of mobile devices exacerbate these
      feasibility problems.

   At all levels of the network hierarchy, the filtration mechanisms
   used to detect undesirable traffic are essentially the same: a censor
   sniffs transmitting packets and identifies undesirable content, and
   then uses a blocking or shaping mechanism to prevent or degrade
   access.  Identification of undesirable traffic can occur at the
   application, transport, or network layer of the IP stack.  Censors
   are almost always concerned with web traffic, so the relevant
   protocols tend to be filtered in predictable ways.  For example, a
   subversive image would always make it past a keyword filter, but the
   IP address of the site serving the image may be blacklisted when
   identified as a provider of undesirable content.

3.2.  Application Layer

3.2.1.  HTTP Request Header Identification

   An HTTP header contains a lot of useful information for traffic
   identification; although host is the only required field in an HTTP
   request header, an HTTP method field is necessary to do anything
   useful. As such, the method and host fields are the two fields used
   most often for ubiquitous censorship.  As a censor, I can sniff
   traffic and identify a specific domain name (host) and usually a page
   name (GET /page) as well.  This identification technique is usually
   paired with TCP/IP header identification for a more robust method.
   Tradeoffs: Request Identification is a technically straight-forward
   identification method that can be easily implemented at the Backbone
   or ISP level.  The hardware needed for this sort of identification is
   cheap and easy-to-acquire, making it desirable when budget and scope
   are a concern.  HTTPS will encrypt the relevant request and response
   fields, so pairing with TCP/IP identification is necessary for
   filtering of HTTPS.

Internet-Draft A Survey of Worldwide Censorship Techniques  October 2014

   Empirical Examples: Studies exploring censorship mechanisms have
   found evidence of HTTP header/ URL filtering in many countries,
   including Bangladesh, Bahrain, China, India, Iran, Malaysia,
   Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey
   [ref-62, ref-63, ref-64]. Commercial
   technologies such as the McAfee SmartFilter and NetSweeper are
   often purchased by censors [ref-2].  These commercial technologies
   use a combination of HTTP Request Identification and TCP/IP Header
   Identification to filter specific URLs. Dalek et al. and Jones et
   al. identified the use of these products in the wild [ref-2, ref-65]

3.2.2.  HTTP Response Header Identification

   Note: I have never heard of this type of filtering being used and
   the reference you provide contradicts your claim- China stopped
   using this form of censorship during the period of their study. I
   don't see a big difference between this and keyword filtering over
   TCP streams, so you may want to consider cutting this section.

   While HTTP Request Header Identification relies on the information
   contained in the HTTP request from client to server, response
   identification uses information sent in response by the server to
   client to identify undesirable content. 


   Note: I'm cutting this portion because many forms of censorship are
   performed by a cluster IDS (this is how almost all of China's
   censorship (TCP RST and DNS response injection) works). A cluster
   IDS is a cluster that receives a copy of traffic and performs
   analysis over the traffic. The content is correct, but I think it
   gives the reader the incorrect impression that cluster IDSs are
   only used for HTTP response filtering.

   cut[ Usually implemented at the Backbone or ISP level, the technique
   normally relies on mirroring, or duplicating the packets such that
   one can provide uninterrupted service while inspecting the
   duplicates for undesirable content, to prevent QoS degradation
   [ref-3] - the mirrored traffic is identified by relevant response
   fields (such as Server or Via).]


   Tradeoffs: As with HTTP Request Header Identification, the
   techniques used to identify HTTP traffic are well-known, cheap, and
   relatively easy to implement, but is made useless by HTTPS, because
   the response in HTTPS is encrypted, including headers. 


   Note: Talking about censorship is always a tradeoff in utility for
   researchers vs the censor, so this may not be worth
   publishing. While the censor cannot use HTTP header fields, they
   can use the SNI header to identify some connections over HTTPS. The
   SNI header is often filled with the Host: field from the HTTP
   header, so depending on the connection, the censor may still be
   able to censor content depending on the SNI field. This is not my
   area of expertise though, so I would need to look into this more to
   write something up.


   The response fields are also less helpful for identifying content
   than request fields, as Server could easily be identified using
   HTTP Request Header identification, and Via is rarely relevant.
   HTTP Response censorship mechanisms normally let the first n
   packets through while the mirrored traffic is being processed; this
   may allow some content through and the user may be able to detect
   that the censor is actively interfering with undesirable content.

   Note: I modified the wording here because a) something could happen
   at the network layer without the browswer processing the data
   (loading implies that the browser processed the data) and b) the
   user would not be able to detect the censorship if the censor
   proxied all connections or if there was high latency to the target
   server (the censor could RST both ends before the user received a
   packet from the target server). (Note that we could detect these
   cases with measurements, but it gets more complicated)


   Empirical Examples: pointing to the "smoking-gun" examples in
   response header identification is difficult for the same reasons
   identifying requests is difficult. 

   Note: I disagree with this statement- if you copy everything from
   an uncensored page and only switch out one element,
   i.e. destination or a single header, you can determine why the
   content was censored. (This assumes that features are independent,
   i.e. that the censor does not require a match on multiple features
   at the same time)

   In 2009, Jong Park et al. at the University of New Mexico
   demonstrated that the Great Firewall of China (GFW) used this
   technique [ref-4]. However, Jong Park et al. found that the GFW
   discontinued this practice during the course of the study. Due to
   the overlap in HTTP response filtering and keyword filtering, it is
   likely that most censors rely on keyword filtering over TCP streams
   instead of HTTP response filtering.

3.2.3.  Instrumenting Content Providers

   Note: I am changing this to generic filtering by an application
   because this is more pervasive that just search engines.

   In addition to censorship by the state, many governments pressure
   content providers to censor themselves. Due to the extensive reach
   of government censorship, we need to define content provider as any
   service that provides utility to users, including everything from
   web sites to locally installed programs. The defining factor of
   keyword identification by content providers is the choice of
   content providers to detect restricted terms on their platform. The
   terms to look for may be provided by the government or the content
   provider may be expected to come up with their own list.

   Tradeoffs: By instrumenting content providers to identify
   restricted content, the censor can gain new information at the cost
   of political capital with the companies it forces or encourages to
   participate in censorship. For example, the censor can gain insight
   about the content of encrypted traffic by coercing web sites to
   identify restricted content, but this may drive away potential
   investment. Coercing content providers may encourage self
   censorship, an additional advantage for censors. The tradeoffs for
   instrumenting content providers are highly dependent on the content
   provider and the requested assistance.

   cut [Tradeoffs: Search Engine Keyword Identification is an inconvenience
   as opposed to a hard block.  As around half of all web traffic
   comes from search [ref-5], disrupting the flow of users to
   undesirable content is an effective method to redirect
   non-dedicated, curious users to less subversive content.  It is
   also likely an effective method at encouraging self-censorship (see
   below) around the blocked content.]


   Empirical Examples: Researchers have discovered keyword
   identification by content providers on platforms ranging from
   instant messaging applications [ref-67] to search engines [ref-66,
   reg-6, ref-8, ref-9, ref-10]. To demonstrate the prevalence of this
   type of keyword identification, we look to search engine
   censorship.

   Search engine censorship demonstrates keyword identification by
   content providers and can be regional or worldwide.  Implementation
   is occasionally voluntary, but normally is based on laws and
   regulations of the country a search engine is operating in. The
   keyword blacklists are most likely maintained by the search engine
   provider. China requires search engine providers to "voluntarily"
   maintain search term blacklists to acquire/keep an ICP license
   [ref-6].  It is clear these blacklists are maintained by each
   search engine provider based on the slight variations in the
   intercepted searches [ref-7][ref-8]. The United Kingdom has been
   pushing search engines to self censor with the threat of litigation
   if they don't do it themselves: Google and Microsoft have agreed to
   block more than 100,00 queries in U.K. to help combat abuse
   [ref-9][ref-10].

   Depending on the output, search engine keyword identification may
   be difficult or easy to detect. In some cases specialized or blank
   results provide a trivial enumeration mechanism, but more subtle
   censorship can be difficult to detect. In February, Microsoft's
   search engine, Bing, was accussed of censoring Chinese content
   outside of China [ref-66] because Bing returned different results
   for censored terms in Chinese and English. However, it is possible
   that censorship of the largest base of Chinese search users, China,
   biased Bing's results so that the more popular results in China
   (the uncensored results) were also more popular for Chinese
   speakers outside of China.




3.2.4.  Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Identification

   Deep Packet Inspection has become computationally feasible as a
   censorship mechanism in the past 5 years [ref-11]. Unlike other
   techniques, DPI reassembles network flows to examine the
   application "data" section, as opposed to only the header, and is
   therefore often used for keyword identification. DPI also differs
   from other identification technologies because it can leverage
   additional packet and flow characteristics, i.e. packet sizes and
   timings, to identify content. To prevent substantial QoS impacts,
   DPI normally analyzes a copy of data while the original packets
   continue to be routed. Typically, the traffic is split using either
   a mirror switch or fiber splitter, and analyzed on a cluster of
   machines running Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) configured for
   censorship.


   Tradeoffs: DPI is one of the most expensive identification
   mechanisms and can have a large QoS impact [ref-12].  When used as
   a keyword filter for TCP flows, DPI systems can cause also major
   overblocking problems. Like other techniques, DPI is less useful
   against encrypted data, though DPI can leverage

   Despite these problems, DPI is the most powerful identification
   method and is widely used in practice. The Great Firewall of China
   (GFW), the largest censorship system in the world, uses DPI to
   identify restricted content over HTTP and DNS and inject TCP RSTs
   and bad DNS responses, respectively, into connections
   [ref-4][ref-68][ref-69].

   Empirical Evidence: Several studies have found evidence of DPI
   being used to censor content and tools. Clayton et al. Crandal et
   al., Anonymous, and Khattak et al., all explored the GFW and
   Khattak et al. even probed the firewall to discover implementation
   details like how much state it stores
   [ref-4][ref-68][ref-69][ref-70]. The Tor project claims that China,
   Iran, Ethiopia, and others must being using DPI to block the obsf2
   protocol [ref-13].  Malaysia has been accused of using target DPI,
   paired with DDoS, to identify and subsequently knockout
   pro-opposition material [ref-14].  It also seems likely that
   organizations not so worried about blocking content in real-time
   could use DPI to sort and categorically search gathered traffic
   using technologies such as NarusInsight [ref-15].

3.3.  Transport Layer

3.3.1.  TCP/IP Header Identification

   TCP/IP Header Identification is the most pervasive, reliable, and
   predictable type of identification.  TCP/IP headers contain a few
   invaluable pieces of information that must be transparent for traffic
   to be successfully routed: destination and source IP address and
   port.  Destination and Source IP are doubly useful, as not only does
   it allow a censor to block undesirable content via IP blacklisting, but
   also allows a censor to identify the IP of the user making the
   request. Port is useful for whitelisting certain applications.


   Note: I disagree with the statement that port is useful for forcing
   users to use a proxy-> they can force you to go through a
   transparent proxy (at the network or application layer) whether you
   are technical or not and these are difficult to detect. I am adding
   proxy as a prevention in the next section, so I will provide more
   info there.


   Trade-offs: TCP/IP identification is popular due to its simplicity,
   availability, and robustness. 


   TCP/IP identification is trivial to implement, but is difficult to
   implement in backbone or ISP routers at scale, and is therefore
   typically implemented with DPI. Blacklisting an IP is equivalent to
   installing a /32 route on a router and due to limited flow table
   space, this cannot scale beyond a few thousand IPs at most. IP
   blocking is also relatively crude, leading to overblocking, and
   cannot deal with some services like Content Distribution Networks
   (CDN), that host content at hundreds or thousands of IP
   addresses. Despite these limitations, IP blocking is extremely
   effective because the user needs to proxy their traffic through
   another destination to circumvent this type of identification.

   Port-blocking is generally not useful because many types of content
   share the same port and it is possible for censored applications to
   change their port. For example, most HTTP traffic goes over port
   80, so the censor cannot differentiate between restricted and
   allowed content solely on the basis of port. Port whitelisting is
   occasionally used, where a censor limits communication to approved
   ports, such as 80 for HTTP traffic and is most effective when used
   in conjuction with other identification mechanisms. For example, a
   censor could block the default HTTPS port, port 443, thereby
   forcing most users to fall back to HTTP.


3.3.2.  Protocol Identification

   Censors sometimes identify entire protocols to be blocked using a
   variety of traffic characteristics.  For example, Iran degrades the
   performance of HTTPS traffic, a procotol that prevents further
   analysis, to encourage users to switch to HTTP, a protocol that
   they can analyze [ref-64]. A simple protocol identification would
   be to recognize all TCP traffic over port 443 as HTTPS, but more
   sophisticated analysis of the statistical properties of payload
   data and flow behavior, would be more effective, even when port 443
   is not used [ref-16][ref-17].

   If censors can detect circumvention tools, they can block them, so
   censors like China are extremely interested in identifying the
   protocols for censorship circumvention tools. In recent years, this
   has devolved into an arms race between censors and circumvention
   tool developers. As part of this arms race, China developed an
   extremely effective protocol identification technique that
   researchers call active probing or active scanning. 

   In active probing, the censor determines whether hosts are running
   a circumvention protocol by trying to initiate communication using
   the circumvention protocol. If the host and the censor successfully
   negotiate a connection, then the censor conclusively knows that
   host is running a circumvention tool. China has used active
   scanning to great effect to block Tor [ref-20].


   Trade-offs: Protocol Identification necessarily only provides
   insight into the way information is traveling, and not the
   information itself. 



Hall & Aaron             Expires April 30, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft A Survey of Worldwide Censorship Techniques  October 2014


   Protocol identification is useful for detecting and blocking
   circumvention tools, like Tor, or traffic that is difficult to
   analyze, like VoIP or SSL, because the censor can assume that this
   traffic should be blocked. However, this can lead to overblocking
   problems when used with popular protocols.  These methods are
   expensive, both computationally and financially, due to the use of
   statistical analysis, and can be ineffective due to its imprecise
   nature.

   Empirical Examples: Protocol identification can be easy to detect
   if it is conducted in real time and only a particular protocol is
   blocked, but some types of protocol identification, like active
   scanning, are much more difficult to detect. Protocol
   identification has been used by Iran to identify and throttle SSH
   traffic to make it unusable [ref-18] and by China to identify and
   block Tor relays [ref-20]. Protocol Identification has also been
   used for traffic management, such as the 2007 case where Comcast in
   the United States used RST injection to interrupt BitTorrent
   Traffic [ref-20].

4.  Technical Prevention

4.1.  Packet Dropping

   Packet dropping is a simple mechanism to prevent undesirable traffic.
   The censor identifies undesirable traffic and chooses to not properly
   forward any packets it sees associated with the traversing
   undesirable traffic instead of following a normal routing protocol.
   This can be paired with any of the previously described mechanisms so
   long as the censor knows the user must route traffic through a
   controlled router.  Trade offs: Packet Dropping is most successful
   when every traversing packet has transparent information linked to
   undesirable content, such as a Destination IP.  One downside Packet
   Dropping suffers from is the necessity of overblocking all content
   from otherwise allowable IP's based on a single subversive sub-
   domain; blogging services and github repositories are good examples.
   China famously dropped all github packets for three days based on a
   single repository hosting undesirable content [ref-21].  The need to
   inspect every traversing packet in close to real time also makes
   Packet Dropping somewhat challenging from a QoS perspective.
   Empirical Examples: Packet Dropping is a very common form of
   technical prevention and lends itself to accurate detection given the
   unique nature of the time-out requests it leaves in its wake.  The
   Great Firewall of China uses packet dropping as one of its primary
   mechanisms of technical censorship [ref-22].  Iran also uses Packet
   Dropping as the mechanisms for throttling SSH [ref-23].  These are
   but two examples of a ubiquitous censorship practice.

4.2.  RST Packet Injection

   Packet injection, generally, refers to a MITM network interference
   technique that spoofs packets in an established traffic stream.  RST
   packets are normally used to let one side of TCP connection know the
   other side has stopped sending information, and thus the receiver
   should close the connection.  RST Packet Injection is a specific type
   of packet injection attack that is used to interrupt an established
   stream by sending RST packets to both sides of a TCP connection; as
   each receiver thinks the other has dropped the connection, the
   session is terminated.  Trade-offs: RST Packet Injection has a few
   advantages that make it extremely popular is a censorship technique.
   RST Packet Injection is an out-of-band prevention mechanism, allowing
   the avoidance of the the QoS bottleneck one can encounter with inline
   techniques such as Packet Dropping.  This out-of-band property allows
   a censor to inspect a copy of the information, usually mirrored by an
   optical splitter, making it an ideal pairing for DPI and Protocol
   Identification[ref-24].  RST Packet Injection also has the advantage
   of only requiring one of the two endpoints to accept the spoofed
   packet for the connection to be interrupted[ref-25].  The difficult
   part of RST Packet Injection is spoofing "enough" correct information
   to ensure one end-point accepts a RST packet as legitimate; this
   generally implies a correct IP, port, and sequence number.  Sequence
   number is the hardest to get correct, as RFC 793 specifies an RST
   Packet should be in-sequence to be accepted, although the RFC also
   recommends allowing in-window packets as "good enough"[ref-26].  This
   in-window recommendation is important, as if it is implement it
   allows for successful Blind RST Injection attacks[ref-27].  When in-
   window sequencing is allowed, It is trivial to conduct a Blind RST
   Injection, a blind injection implies the censor doesn't know any
   sensitive (encrypted) sequencing information about the TCP stream
   they are injecting into, they can simply enumerate the ~70000
   possible windows; this is particularly useful for interrupting
   encrypted/obfuscated protocols such as SSH or Tor. RST Packet
   Injection relies on a stateful network, making it useless against UDP
   connections.  RST Packet Injection is among the most popular
   censorship techniques used today given its versatile nature and
   effectiveness against all types of TCP traffic.  Empirical Examples:
   RST Packet Injection, as mentioned above, is most often paired with
   identification techniques that require splitting, such as DPI or
   Protocol Identification.  In 2007 Comcast was accused of using RST
   Packet Injection to interrupt traffic it identified as BitTorrent
   [ref-28], this later led to a FCC ruling against Comcast [ref-29].
   China has also been known to use RST Packet Injection for censorship
   purposes.  This prevention is especially evident in the interruption
   of encrypted/obfuscated protocols, such as those used by Tor
   [ref-30].

4.3.  DNS Cache Poisoning

   DNS Cache Poisoning refers to a mechanism where a censor interferes
   with the response sent by a DNS resolver to the requesting device by
   injecting an alternative IP address on the return path.  Cache
   poisoning occurs after the requested site's name servers resolve the
   request and attempt to forward the IP back to the requesting device;
   on the return route the resolved IP is recursively cached by each DNS
   servers that initially forwarded the request.  During this caching
   process if an undesirable keyword is recognized, the resolved IP is
   poisoned and an alternative IP is returned.  These alternative IP's
   usually direct to a nonsense domain or a warning page[ref-31].
   Alternatively, Iranian censorship appears to prevent the
   communication en-route, preventing a response from ever being
   sent[ref-32].  Trade-offs: DNS Cache Poisoning is one of the rarer
   forms of prevention due to a number of shortcomings.  DNS Cache
   Poisoning requires the censor to force a user to traverse a
   controlled DNS resolver for the mechanism to be effective, it is
   easily circumvented by a technical savvy user that opts to use
   alternative DNS resolvers, such as the 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 public DNS
   resolvers provided by Google.  DNS Cache Poisoning also implies
   returning an incorrect IP to those attempting to resolve a domain
   name, but the site is still technically unblocked if the user has
   another method to acquire the IP address of the desired site.
   Blocking overflow has also been a problem, as occasionally users
   outside of the censors region will be directed through a DNS server
   controlled by a censor, causing the request to fail.  The ease of
   circumvention paired with the large risk of overblocking and blocking
   overflow make DNS Cache Poisoning a partial, difficult, and less than
   ideal censorship mechanism.  Empirical Evidence: DNS Cache Poisoning,
   when properly implemented, is easy to identify based on the
   shortcomings identified above.  Turkey relied on DNS Cache Poisoning
   for its country-wide block of websites such Twitter and Youtube for
   almost week in March of 2014 but the ease of circumvention resulted
   in an increase in the popularity of Twitter until Turkish ISP's
   implementing an IP blacklist to achieve the governmental
   mandate[ref-33].  To drive proverbial "nail in the coffin" Turkish
   ISPs started hijacking all requests to Google and Level 3's
   international DNS resolvers [ref-34].  DNS Cache Poisoning, when
   incorrectly implemented, has as has resulted in some of the largest
   "censorship disasters".  In January 2014 China started directing all
   requests passing through the Great Fire Wall to a single domain,
   dongtaiwang.com, due to an improperly configured DNS Cache Poisoning
   attempt; this incident is thought to be the largest internet-service
   outage in history [ref-35][ref-36].  Countries such as China, Iran,
   Turkey, and the United States have discussed blocking entire TLDs as
   well, but only Iran has acted by blocking all Israeli (.il) domains
   [ref-37].

4.4.  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

   Distributed Denial of Service attacks are a common attack mechanism
   used by "hacktivists" and black-hat hackers, but censors have used
   DDoS in the past for a variety of reasons.  There is a huge variety
   of DDoS attacks[ref-38], but on a high level two possible impacts
   tend to occur; a flood attack results in the service being unusable
   while resources are being spent to flood the service, a crash attack
   aims to crash the service so resources can be reallocated elsewhere
   without "releasing" the service.  Trade-offs: DDoS is an appealing
   mechanism when a censor would like to prevent all access to
   undesirable content, instead of only access in their region for a
   limited period of time, but this is really the only uniquely
   beneficial feature for DDoS as a censorship technique.  The resources
   required to carry out a successful DDoS against major targets are
   computationally expensive, usually requiring renting or owning a
   malicious distributed platform such as a botnet, and imprecise.  DDoS
   is an incredibly crude censorship technique, and appears to largely
   be used as a timely, easy-to-access mechanism for blocking
   undesirable content for a limited period of time.  Empirical
   Examples: In 2012 the U.K.'s GCHQ used DDoS to temporarily shutdown
   IRC chat rooms frequented by members of Anonymous using the Syn Flood
   DDoS method; Syn Flood exploits the handshake used by TCP to overload
   the victim server with so many requests that legitimate traffic
   becomes slow or impossible [ref-39][ref-40].  Dissenting opinion
   websites are frequently victims of DDoS around politically sensitive
   events in Burma [ref-41].  Controlling parties in Russia[ref-42],
   Zimbabwe[ref-43], and Malaysia[ref-44] have been accused of using
   DDoS to interrupt opposition support and access during elections.

4.5.  Network Disconnection or Adversarial Route Announcement

   Network Disconnection or Adversarial Route Announcement The crudest
   of all censorship techniques, there is no more effective way of
   making sure undesirable information isn't allowed to propagate on the
   web than by shutting off the network.  The network can be cut off in
   a region when a censoring body withdraws all of the BGP prefixes
   routing through the censor's country.  Trade-offs: The impact to a
   network disconnection in a region is huge and absolute; the censor
   pays for absolute control over digital information with all the
   benefits the internet brings; this is never a long-term solution for
   any rational censor and is normally only used as a last resort in
   times of substantial unrest.  Empirical Examples: Network
   Disconnections tend to only happen in times of substantial unrest,
   largely due to the huge social, political, and economic impact such a
   move has.  One of the first, highly covered occurrences was with the
   Junta in Myanmar employing Network Disconnection to help Junta forces
   quash a rebellion in 2007 [ref-45].  China disconnected the network

   in the Xinjiang region during unrest in 2009 in an effort to prevent
   the protests from spreading to other regions [ref-46].  The Arab
   Spring saw the the most frequent usage of Network Disconnection, with
   events in Egypt and Libya in 2011 [ref-47][ref-48], and Syria in 2012
   [ref-49].

5.  Non-Technical Aggregation

   As the name implies, sometimes manpower is the easiest way to
   figure out which content to block.  Manual Filtering differs from
   the common tactic of building up blacklists in that is doesn't
   necessarily target a specific IP or DNS, but instead removes or
   flags content.  Given the imprecise nature of automatic filtering,
   manually sorting through content and flagging dissenting websites,
   blogs, articles and other media for filtration can be an effective
   technique.  This filtration can occur on the Backbone/ISP level,
   China's army of monitors is a good example [ref-50]; more commonly
   manual filtering occurs on an institutional level.  (Internet
   Content Provider?) ICP's, such as Google or Weibo, require a
   business license to operate in China.  One of the prerequisites for
   a business license is an agreement to sign a "voluntary pledge"
   known as the "Public Pledge on Self-discipline for the Chinese
   Internet Industry".  The failure to " energetically uphold" the
   pledged values can lead to the ICP's being held liable for the
   offending content by the Chinese government [ref-51].

6.  Non-Technical Prevention

6.1.  Self Censorship

   Self censorship is one of the most interesting and effective types of
   censorship; a mix of Bentham's Panopticon, cultural manipulation,
   intelligence gathering, and meatspace enforcement.  Simply put, self
   censorship is when a censor creates an atmosphere where users censor
   themselves.  This can be achieved through controlling information,
   intimidating would-be dissidents, swaying public thought, and
   creating apathy.  Self censorship is difficult to document, as when
   it is implemented effectively the only noticeable tracing is a lack
   of undesirable content; instead one must look at the tools and
   techniques used by censors to encourage self-censorship.  Controlling
   Information relies on traditional censorship techniques, or by
   forcing all users to connect through an intranet, such as in North
   Korea.  Intimidation is often achieved through allowing internet
   users to post "whatever they want", but arresting those who post
   about dissenting views, this technique is incredibly
   common[ref-52][ref-53][ref-54][ref-55][ref-56].  A good example of
   swaying public thought is China's "50-Cent Party", composed of
   somewhere between 20,000[ref-57] and 300,000[ref-58] contributors who
   are paid to "guide public thought" on local and regional issues as

   directed by the Ministry of Culture.  Creating apathy can be a side-
   effect of successfully controlling information over time and is ideal
   for a censorship regime [ref-59].

6.2.  Domain Name Reallocation

   As Domain Names are resolved recursively, if a TLD deregisters a
   domain all other DNS resolvers will be unable to properly forward and
   cache the site.  Domain name registration is only really a risk where
   undesirable content is hosted on TLD controlled by the censoring
   country, such as .ch or .ru [ref-60].

6.3.  Server Takedown

   Servers must have a physical location somewhere in the world.  If
   undesirable content is hosted in the censoring country the servers
   can be physically seized or the hosting provider can be required to
   prevent access [ref-61].
