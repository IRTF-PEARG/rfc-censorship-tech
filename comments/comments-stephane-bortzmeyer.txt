Hello,

I've just read draft-hall-censorship-tech-00 and I think it is a very
useful document. I'm always a bit split with documenting the
censorship since it *may* help the censors as well but I believe they
have typically more information than the average citizen, so it's
better to inform the good guys.

But I am not happy with the sections about the DNS. First, the title
"DNS Cache Poisoning" is very misleading since not all
censorship-via-DNS target the cache. "DNS cache poisoning" describes a
limited set of specific attacks and you should not use it to describe
any DNS mangling. Otherwise, discussions about possible solutions
would be impossible (for instance, DNSSEC fixes the problem of DNS
cache poisoning but certainly not all the DNS censorship techniques).

The first sentence is specially confusing: "DNS Cache Poisoning refers
to a mechanism where a censor interferes with the response sent by a
DNS resolver to the requesting device by injecting an alternative IP
address on the return path." If it is done after the resolver, the
cache will never see the alternative IP address and so won't be
poisoned.

"DNS Cache Poisoning is one of the rarer forms of prevention" In
France, it is the most common since it is mandated by law for at least
two cases (illegal gambling and promotion of terrorism).

Also, the section is self-contradictoy when it says "it is easily
circumvented by a technical savvy user that opts to use alternative
DNS resolvers" while mentioning later than Turkey solved the problem
of circumvention by hijacking Google Public DNS' addresses. Unlike
what you seem to imply, it was a success for the turkish government,
very difficult to circumvent (Google does not use any authentication
technique on Google Public DNS and, besides, there is little deployment
of these techniques in the DNS.)

In the same section "the site is still technically unblocked if the
user has another method to acquire the IP address of the desired
site" is false for HTTP (unless the Web site is the only one
listening at this IP address: otherwise, without a proper Host: field,
using the IP address won't work).

"occasionally users outside of the censors region will be directed
through a DNS server controlled by a censor, causing the request to
fail" If you refer to the root-servers-in-China / Chile case, the
requests never went "through a DNS server controlled by a censor". In
China, this DNS mangling is done by network equipment, and does not
require a DNS server.

Later in the document, there is again sloppy wording about the
DNS. "As Domain Names are resolved recursively, if a TLD deregisters a
domain all other DNS resolvers..." Which "other resolvers"? The TLD
name servers are not resolvers. Also, the example "such as .ch or .ru"
is poorly choosen since I am not aware of any case of censorship by
the swiss TLD ("reference needed", as they say in Wikipedia). Better
to use .com as an example (operation "In our sites" by the ICE).

I'm in Honolulu for IETF 91, if you want to talk AFK (I'll try to be
at the SAAG meeting).

Editorial: ref-33 and ref-34 are identical.
